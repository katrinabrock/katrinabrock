I wrote this in October 2020 intending to revise it but haven't so far. Some of the info is out of date, but a lot if it isn't.

# AC :arrow_right: Tech Tips

This guide is geared toward MS and PhD students and recent grads in the US interested in transitioning to tech. Specifically, folks in who have done at some quantitative/coding work in an academic context, but who fall outside of ENG/CS/Stats looking to transition to a career in Software Engineering or Data Science. This is based on my the personal experience and is certainly not definitive or exhaustive.

## Exploration
So you're considering a career outside of academia? Fear not, many have tread this path and not only lived to tell the tale, but had balanced lives and prosperous careers.
 
### Generic pros and cons
 
**Tech career advantages**
- **Compensation** When I was making this decision in 2016, on the academic side, I was looking at ~3 more years as a grad student at ~$35K/year (NSF GRFP), plus 1-4 years of postdoc at best-case-scenario $80K/year, then if I was extremely successful/lucky a faculty position where I would finally (~6 years later) be making a salary of a highly skilled worker. Or....I could master out and get a tech job in the SF Bay area and immediately start making ~$100K/year. PhD grads going into Data Science at the time in SF Bay year would be looking at more like $150K/year. Of course, your mileage may vary especially in other parts of the country/world. Take a look at glassdoor/payscale.com for the specific region/role you're interested in and compare to your own possible academic career.
- **Probability of viable career** As you probably know, there are *way* more PhDs minted each year than full time academic positions available. Tech jobs (especially top tier jobs) can be competitive too but not *nearly* as competitive as faculty positions. There is always the worry of getting trapped as an adjunct or perpetual post-doc.  
- **Work-life balance** There is no guarantee here, but in general I would say it's easier to find a true 40hr/week tech job with paid vacation than a truly 40/hr week academic job with paid vacation. Of course there are certainly many companies (especially start-ups) that will expect/pressure you to over-work and presumably academics who achieve a healthy work-life balance. This can also depend on how much leverage your employer has over you.
- **Clear objectives** In industry, there is one clear, measurable, overall objective: make more money for the company. If you have a good manager, they will even break down your role into SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Oriented) objectives. As an academic researcher, you have to set the direction for your own research, set objectives, determine milestones. Especially in basic science, the overall goal of advancing human knowledge is less measurable. Additionally, once you've chosen your direction, you have to be your own salesperson convincing colleagues, journal editors, and funders that your research is worthy and important.  Some folks may find the corporate environment restrictive, but for me this is a plus.
 
**Academic career advantages**
- **Setting Your own objectives** The flipside of the above is that you (often) *get* to set your own research direction. If you're passionate about you research area, this can be a major advantage. There are very few jobs outside of academia where you have the same freedom to set your direction.
- **Opportunity to teach** If you love teaching, this can be an important factor.
- **Intellectual growth** The #1 thing I miss about the academic environment is intellectual rigor and constant exposure to new ideas. It's certainly possible to continue learning and exposing yourself to new ideas within or in addition to a full time tech job. However, in academia, attending seminars on different topics, chatting with others about their research, getting exposed to experts in your field and adjacent fields is the default.  

 
### Informational interviews
One of the best ways to learn about a potential career is to chat with someone in the field you are considering. You might be surprised that professionals are willing to give up an hour of their time to help a near stranger, but many are. Here are some ways to find them:
- Alums of your lab/program/adjacent programs: Ideally reach out through a mutual contact. Otherwise, reach out through email or LinkedIn.
- Alumni events through your grad or undergrad institution
- Alt Ac Seminars
- Career services office at your grad or undergrad institution: They may offer matchmaking for informational interviews.
- Conferences attended by industry folks: They often have special student/academic rates. If you can get your fees reimbursed through your lab/school all the better.
- Social media: I wouldn't recommend cold-calling random people in the field you want to be in without a connection (e.g. same institution/program, mutual contact who can make an intro), but some people specifically make themselves available for this kind of discussion in their bio.
 
There's plenty of advice on the internet about informational interviews: crafting a request, what to ask, etiquette, etc. I won't reiterate here, but be sure to check these out.
 
I'm extremely grateful to the folks who took time to talk to me when I was at the very beginning of my career. <3
 
### Dipping your toes in
Remember, you don\'t need to have your entire career planned out today. You can do some interviews and take an internship or two, and then decide whether to focus on academic jobs, tech jobs, or something else.
 
## Resume
### Translating your experience
A CV is not a resume. There are plenty of resources available on resume writing and tech resume writing written by folks with far more experience than me. (Even specific articles on CV vs resume.) Here I\'ll try to focus on key differences between industry and academia in evaluating candidates. I am not an expert here, but I have seen some common pitfalls.
 
- **Make sure details relevant to the role are easy to find** Especially for an internship/entry level role, potential manager/hiring manager does not care about everything in your academic career that led you to this point. They are trying to determine whether you will be successful in the role you are applying for. The first scan of your resume will determine whether they read more so the most relevant information must be highlighted, not buried in the statistical methods section of a linked publication.  
- **Resume should be a summary, not a detailed list of accomplishments** The more irrelevant/overly detailed information you include in your resume, the harder it will be to find the important details. If you are a Masters/PhD student or fresh grad, unless you have substantial additional relevant work experience, you should be able to write a one page resume. You can do this by summarizing, not omitting your experience.
- **Write to a reviewer who is not familiar with your field**  And thus does not know what experiences and skills are typical of someone in your field so you have to tell them. Think about how much you know about the skills, experience, and research methods of researchers in unrelated departments across campus.
- **Impact is important** This is similar, but not identical to the "Broader Impacts" section in many grant applications. Connect the dots between your research and outcomes or potential outcomes of success e.g. human health or conservation. Be specific about the connection.
- **Quantify wherever possible** How many students did you TA? How many applicants and how many awardees for the grant you got? How large was your dataset?
 
Here are some examples on specific experiences you many want to include and possible details to include:
 
- **TAships** Don't list every single course especially if there are a lot. Summarize. How many courses? How many semesters? What general areas? What were your duties? If your TAship involved teaching stats, coding, or research methods, you may want to mention that explicitly. Any awards/recognitions you got or the courses you got that you contributed to. If you were a lecturer/instructor of record make that explicit.
- **Supervised undergrads/others** How many? For how long? Most importantly, what was the outcome of the project?
- **Research Projects** What did you do? What was the outcome? At most, should be the length of an abstract, but with the focus on your contribution ideas you contributed, work you performed or supervised. Mention publications/talks/posters/awards if applicable.
- **Stats/modeling** Include methods/models you used in research/publications. Do not make reviewers dig for this information. Don\'t list anything you would be uncomfortable discussing in an interview.  
- **Coding** If you have written a substantial amount of code (i.e. with functions, loops, multiple scripts not just import data + run pre-built model) make that clear. If you coded up a simulation yourself, wrote a package, deployed code to a server or cloud service, worked on code collaboratively, and/or contributed to open source projects, include that information. Include outcomes. e.g. if your program has a web interface how many people use it and how does it help them? is your lab using a tool you build in an ongoing way? why? As far as languages and tools, mention all that you would feel comfortable being quizzed on. I find it more compelling to mention languages, tools, and models alongside the project you used them for rather than in a separate list. It can be helpful to include a link to github if a substantial amount of your work is publically available there, but do not assume your reviewer is combing it. Include the relevant info in your resume.
- **Publications** You do not need to include a full bibliography of your publications. Instead, summarize the volume, topics, and impact. If you've been published in especially prestigious journals, mention the journals.
 
### Getting feedback
- Fellow academics can be helpful in proofreading, checking wording, etc. If you know someone else applying to industry roles, you can suggest mutually reviewing each others resume.
- Anyone who has been involved in hiring decisions for a company can help you figure out if you have successfully conveyed your message clearly. Of course, the closer they are to your target role, the better.
- Your industry contacts can be helpful here too. See "Informational Interview" section.
- Career services often offers resume critiques
 
## How to Apply
Applying through a company's website without a referral or contact with a recruiter is extremely unlikely to result in a callback. Same for applying through a generic job site like indeed/monster/linkedin. Many of these jobs are not even available, but are posted because in some situations companies are legally required to post jobs externally before hiring an internal candidate.
 
Getting a referral either from an existing employee or recruiter is probably the most sure fire way to get a call back. This is part of why your first job will be your hardest to get.
 
Here are some other options for finding relevant jobs:
- **University job boards** Don't forget about your undergrad institution if you still have access.
- **University email lists**
- **Career Fairs** Come prepared. Know your target company and target roles. Bring your resume and talking points. Consider it a mini-interview. There's plenty of advice out there on preparing for job fairs.
- **Tech-specific job sites** I've had luck with stackoverflow jobs and AngelList. Hackernews also has monthly job postings.
 
## Interview Preparation
 
### Your Story
At the end of your interview, your interviewer will write down what they remember from your conversation. If you send a clear message, they will write down that message. A strategy someone shared with me and has worked well is to come up with the top three reasons you will be successful in the role. For each reason, come up with two to three experiences that demonstrate each reason. You can think of it like a persuasive essay where the overall thesis is "I am the candidate who will be most likely to deliver desired results in this role." then build out your subpoints and supporting examples.
 
For example, one reason could be "I can effectively communicate complex models to a non-technical audience." (Assuming that is required for the job.) Then you can have one specific example of when you did this while you were TAing freshmen, one where you were mentoring undergrads in your lab, and one where you explained your research methods at an interdisciplinary conference. Also think about how this connects to the actual job.
 
### Coding Interview
If you are interviewing for a software engineering job, it is highly likely that you will face either a whiteboard coding interview or taking home coding challenge or both. These tend to be fairly standardized. If you are in grad school, you have likely studied for and succeeded at standardized tests so you can approach this in a similar way. The definitive guide is the book "Cracking the Coding Interview", but if you don't have time for a 700+ page book, doing a few practice problems online can go a long way.
 
It's also likely that you will be asked questions verbally about the technologies you claim to be proficient in on your resume.  
 
Note: If your goal is Facebook/Apple/Google, first of all, this guide is probably woefully insufficient. Second of all, you will need to do much more in terms of studying for this test especially without a CS background.
 
### Generic interview questions
Come up with a list (e.g. by googling) of both technical and non-technical questions you expect the interviewer to ask and practice coming up with responses that link back to the story you want to tell.
 
In particular, you should be prepared for the interviewer to ask "Do you have any questions for us?" Ask questions specifically related to the work, the job, and the team. Save logistical questions for the recruiter/HR rep. Remember, this is also your opportunity to try to determine if this is a good place for you to intern/work. For example, if you ask a question of your prospective manager like "Three months into this role, how will you evaluate whether your new hire has been successful?" you can get some insight into the expectations of the role and if the manager can't articulate how success will be measured, that tells you something too.
 
### Practice Interviews
If you can get someone to do a practice interview with you, all the better. Consider reaching out to the same folks listed under resume review.
 
## Negotiating Offers
For internships, the terms are usually pre-set. For full time roles, you can and should negotiate on salary and signing bonus.  
 
## One Day Upskills
 
If you want to spend one day learning a tech skill that employers may ask about, here are some suggestions (likely skewed toward my background in DevOps):
- **Kaggle Competitions** I don't have personal experience with this, but have heard good things.
- **Advanced Git** I'd recommend bitbucket tutorials in combination with creating a test repo or two (even creating your own remote), trying different things, and making sure you understand the concepts thoroughly. For example, merge vs. rebase, squash, interactive rebase, git vs github, manually editing author/date in commit messages, merge commits.
- **Docker** Try installing docker desktop and learning to run you existing code inside a docker container. For R, the rocker = R + Docker. For python, the image is simply called python.
- **Python** If you've only used R, Matlab, or some other scientific-oriented language. It may be worthwhile to spend an afternoon trying out python. e.g. importing a dataset and running a model you're already familiar with.
- **SQL** If you're not already familiar, it can be worthwhile for both to go through an online tutorial.
- **Simple Web App** If you are familiar with R, try out R Shiny. If you are familiar with python, try making a simple website using django or flask.
- **Cloud Services** This one I recommend with a bit of trepidation because it is not free and in fact it can be very easy to inadvertently run up an expensive bill. Proceed with caution and careful reading of pricing schemes and how to set up a cost cap. With that caveat, you may want to create an account on one of AWS/GCP/Azure/Heroku/DigitalOcean and try getting your existing code to run "in the cloud". There are *many* ways to do this, which is part of the challenge. Sometimes these providers offer the first few hundred dollars free or if you have access through your lab or otherwise you may want to take advantage of that.
- **Online Code Challenges** like hackerrank or codewars. This is more about preparing for the technical interview than something you would mention in your resume/interview.
- **Hackathons** there may even be some sponsored by your institution
 
This is *not* a list of requirements/prerequisites. Simply ways to add on to your technical skill set if desired. One day of experience may not be enough to warrant adding to your resume, but likely worth mentioning in the interview if relevant to the role.
 
## Summary
- Use your career services office.
- Tech and academic employers have different backgrounds and are looking for different things. Tune your message to your audience.
- Don't be afraid to test the waters
