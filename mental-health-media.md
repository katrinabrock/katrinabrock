This is a (WIP) index of noteworth mental related books, videos, audio, etc. that I've encountered with some notes.

# Depression

## Empathetic

* **Intentionally Blank Podcast - Ep. 201 How We Fight Depression** Empathetic conversation between two friends about depression.
Good for someone whose loved one has depression to increase understanding
or for someone with depression to feel less alone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36cZrFRf1Mo

* **Caroline Winkler's "how to REFRESH your space when you're feeling low energy"** Austensibly "interior design for depressed people", but it gets real.
Good for if you're looking for ideas of tiny things that might be doable.
