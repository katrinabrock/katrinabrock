# Brock's Review Comment Badges
## Purpose

When I review a PR and "Request Changes", I like to make it clear to the author which comments need to be addressed in order for me to approve the PR and which comments are...just comments.

## Badge Meanings

### Version .1

[<img src="https://badges.ws/badge/change%20request-ff5555" />](https://github.com/katrinabrock/katrinabrock/blob/main/review-comment-badges.md) - Comments with this badge need to be addressed before I approve the PR. That doesn't mean you have to do exactly what I'm suggesting or even change the code. It's possible that a justification is all that's needed. PR reviews marked as "Request Changes" will have at least one of this type of comment (or direclty request a change in the PR summary).

[<img src="https://badges.ws/badge/comment-6272a4" />](https://github.com/katrinabrock/katrinabrock/blob/main/review-comment-badges.md) - This badge indicates that I am comfortable merging the PR regardless without the author responding to the comment in any way. The comment may contain suggestions, but they should be considered completely optional.

[<img src="https://badges.ws/badge/done-green" />](https://github.com/katrinabrock/katrinabrock/blob/main/review-comment-badges.md) - Comments with this badge used to have the `change request` badge but are now resolved to my satisfaction as the reviewer. (I don't use the github "Resolve" feature for this because the PR author maybe using it for other purposes e.g. keeping track of which comments they have attempted to address.)

## Feedback

Was this helpful? Confusing? Unnecessarily complex? I'm looking for feedback on this system! If I'm reviewing your PR you probably know how to get in touch with me. You can also feel free to open an issue on this repo.
