## Name and Pronouns
I go by "Brock" in conversation and use they/them pronouns in English, sie/sie in German.

In "Full Name" situations (official documents, paper authorship, etc.), I use "Katrina Brock".

## Profession
I work for the Max Plank Insitute of Animal Behavior supporting scientists in their data management and programming needs.

Materials for workshops I've run can be found [here](https://github.com/livingingroups/eas-coding-workshops).

## Open Source 

I typically enjoy making smallish contributions to existing projects. I particularly enjoy contributing to the infrastructure aspect of projects in the R ecosystem.

Examples:
- [HTML Validation for bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/pull/1495)
- [Performance Improvement in ctmm](https://github.com/ctmm-initiative/ctmm/pull/60)
- [Mocking cmdstand in cmdstanr testing](https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstanr/pull/1078)

I also love to both give and recieve detailed feedback on code and processes. It's a great way to learn!
